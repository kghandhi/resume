\section{EXPERIENCE}
\textit{Sprout Social}, Chicago, IL \\
\textbf{Platform Engineer} (intern then part time) \hspace*{\fill} \textbf{June 2015 - present}
\begin{itemize} 
%\item Expanding and supporting the existing python REST API by collecting and aggregating data from Google+, Google Analytics, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn to develop reports about businesses' social media presence. This includes interfacing with three data stores (a relational database (mySQL), a noSQL database (Cassandra), and a distributed cluster (Hadoop)) and interacting with the data with MapReduce jobs\\
%\item Researched, designed and implemented a report that collects historical data from a Twitter platform allowing users to track the popularity of search terms across Twitter. Prototyped, tested, and optimized the functionality of the implementation with threading and heavy caching in mySQL and Cassandra.  
%\item Verifying existing data and the methods by which that data is collected
%\item Expanding a new API endpoint that makes accessing pre-aggregated data easy for the front end
\item Utilized MySQL, Cassandra and Hadoop to cache, aggregate, and analyze social networking data exposed via a python REST API.
\item Built upon existing interfaces to and cross-validated data collected from Google+, Google Analytics, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.
\item Spearheaded the research, design, implementation, and testing of a new, concurrent interface to Twitter historical data that allows users to track the popularity of keywords over time.
\item Built support for a new metric involving polling data from Instagram, storing it in HBase, and aggregating it with MapReduce to store it in Cassandra where it is accessible to the API.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Mission Street Manufacturing}, Santa Barbara, CA \\
\textbf{Software Engineering Intern} \hspace*{\fill} \textbf{June 2014 - August 2014}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed agile front- and back-end in a cross-functional team for critical user-facing feature that shipped with all 3D printers allowing users to replace printing filament
\item Full stack engineer across iOS (Swift), web services (Python/Flask), and embedded hardware (Python running on a Raspberry Pi)
\item Wrote unit, functional, and integration tests to cover both new and legacy code
\item Documented the changes in design documents and diagrams
\end{itemize}

\textit{Department of Mathematics, University of Chicago}, Chicago, IL \\
\textbf{VIGRE Course Assistant}   \hspace*{\fill} \textbf{October 2013 - June 2014}
\begin{itemize} 
\item Collected, graded, and promptly returned homework assignments for introductory calculus
\item Assigned more than a dozen students of diverse skill levels in informal weekly office hours 
\item Developed teaching and communication skills
\end{itemize}

\section{ACTIVITIES} 
\textbf{REU in Mathematics}, \textit{University of Chicago}, Chicago, IL \hspace{\fill} \textbf{Summer 2013}
\begin{itemize}
%\item Excelled in 8-week program in high-level mathematics. Topics included linear algebra, algebraic topology, geometry, logic, probability, and analysis 
\item Wrote a paper entitled ``Khovanov Homology as an Invariant" with guidance from graduate students in mathematics and the professors of the courses (available at \url{http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2013/REUPapers/Ghandhi.pdf})
\end{itemize}

\textbf{COSMOS Summer of Mathematics}, \textit{UC Davis}, Davis, CA \hspace{\fill} \textbf{Summer 2010}
\begin{itemize}
%\item Accepted to and excelled in an 8-week long summer program of college-level classes at UC Davis. Topics included combinatorics, topology (mostly knot theory), and symmetry
\item Wrote a paper entitled ``Check Digits" based on individual research (available at \url{http://cosmos.ucdavis.edu/archives/2010/cluster6/Ghandi\_Kira.pdf}) 
\end{itemize}
